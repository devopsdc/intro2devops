# Agenda

* Introductions
* Why DevOps
* Why Diversity
* Goals for the Day

Note: Good morning. We'll get rolling here. Before we get into the meat of Devop tooling, let's set the stage with introductions, and a bit of background on why of DevOps, the why of building a more diverse cadre of devops practitioners


----


# Introductions

- Break into teams. In each team:
  - Name and one personal thing
    - Pets? Siblings?
  - Why are you here today?
  - What does "DevOps" mean to you?
  - What do you hope comes out of this?
  - What scares you about this?

Note: Introductions matter. Feel free to take some time on this -- because I'll better understand what you're bringing to the experience, and because communication and trust are core to DevOps practices - people matter! Image from Pink Floyd (if time). Pull 'Goal' cards to join Keepers into teams.

# Introductions

## Reporting Back

# <span style="color:red">My DevOps Story</span>

Note: This is when I extemporize on a scientist, sysadmin, webops at DLESE, experience in the real world, then the DevOps movement.  And I'm like, "Oh, this is what we did before someone told us it was wrong!"

# The DevOps Movement

## <br>
## <br>

Note: Traditional dev/ops wall, Devops brings devops practices to operations: TDD, code collaboration, and release practices. Empowers devs with authority to push to production, and the responsibility to handle to operational consequences.  The entails communication and trust.

# <span style="color:red">Why Diversity?</span>



Note: It's no secret that the technology sector has a diversity problem
 could go into the personal reasons but I don't want to sound too self-congratulatory, so instead I'll talk about Chef and the economics of diversifying.

---

# Technical Goals

- Enough Chef to roll out a customized website
- Enough Github and Jenkins to collaborate
- Enough AWS to operationalize our site

# Notes on Pedagogy

- You set the pace. We have no 'agenda'
- We'll keep a 'parking lot' for some topics
- Pairing:
  - Driving
  - Navigating
- Tools: Slack (chat) and Slides (GitHub)

# Next: Lab 0

We'll do [Lab 0](lab-0_remote_ws_and_atom.md) to make sure we have our setup working,
then dive into Infrastructure Automation.
