# About Resources

A resource is a statement of configuration policy that:

* Describes the desired state for a configuration item
* Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state
* Specifies a resource type---such as ``package``, ``template``, or ``service``
* Lists additional details (also known as attributes), as necessary
* Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configurations

----

# Objectives

* Understand resource types

----

# Resources - Syntax

A resource is a statement of configuration policy that:

* Describes the desired state for a configuration item
* Declares the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state
* Specifies a resource type---such as ``package``, ``template``, or ``service``
* Lists additional details (also known as attributes), as necessary
* Are grouped into recipes, which describe working configuraitons

----

# Objectives

* Understand the resource syntax
* Understand how to declare resources in recipes

----

# Syntax - Resource Type

A resource has a type:

```ruby
file
```

----

# Syntax - Resource Name

A resource has a name:

```ruby
file "hello.txt"
```

----

# Syntax - Resource Keywords

```ruby
file "hello.txt" do
   ...
end
```

----

# Syntax - Resource Action

A resource describes the state of something by declaring an action:

```ruby
 file "hello.txt" do
   action :create
 end
```

----

# Syntax - Resource Syntax In Plain English


The file named ``hello.txt`` should be created:

```ruby
 file "hello.txt" do

```

----

# Syntax - Resource Attributes


A resource includes additional details---attributes:

```ruby
file "hello.txt" do

file "hello.txt" do
 action :create
 content "Hello, world!"
 mode "0644"
 owner "chef"
 group "chef"
end
```

#  Objectives

* Understand how resources test and repair the system

----

# Test and Repair

Resources follow a test and repair model:

* Is a resource currently in the desired state? (test)
* If YES, do nothing
* If NO, then bring the resource into the desired state (repair)
